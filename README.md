About Digital Image and Video Processing

## Content:
Image creation (capture, sampling and reconstruction of images and perception of image information); colors and color images (physical meaning of colors, color models, spaces and metrics, comparison and conversion between color spaces); image histograms and information theory; interpolation and decimation of images; displaying images; image mappings (intensity and geometric mappings); image condensing; spatial image filtering (core, statistical and morphological filtering); decomposition of images (with derivatives or edging, adjustment, sorting and models, Hough mapping, analysis of basic components); frequency analysis of images; filtering images in the frequency domain; video processing and analysis (detection, analysis and evaluation of movements, movement vector, noise filtering, detection and removal of stains, elimination of flicker); recording standards and quality of image and video communication services.

## Results:
- define a picture or video as a multidimensional signal;
- compare different ways of displaying images and videos and their presentation in color spaces;
- distinguish between different aspects of image and video sampling (image element resolution, spatial, spectral, temporal and radiometric resolution);
- distinguish between different standards for image and video compression from the point of view of information theory;
- select the appropriate method for filtering images in the spatial or frequency domain for the purposes of a given application;
- use different image mapping techniques (intensity mappings, geometric mappings);
- develop simplified computer algorithms for solving problems in the field of image and video processing;
- evaluate existing and new methods for image and video processing.
